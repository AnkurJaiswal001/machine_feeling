An Emoji-ful introduction to computer vision and machine learning.

-----

### Introduction :smirk:
This small project is intended as an introduction to some of the fundamental ideas of machine learning and computer vision. Specifically, this introduces the problem of categorizing images (along with some potential solutions).

Our goal in this project is to walk through how a project like this may work.

-----

### Goal :worried:
The problem herein is that we want to be able to identify the unicode of emoji when we see them on the Internet. In this (somewhat contrived) scenario, we, the enterprising young computer scientists, have decided to build software to perform several tasks in accomplishing this goal:
1. We need a way to "take a picture" or photograph something within our computer (i.e. something we see on the Internet). We could do this by using our phone or a screen shot software. But we are grade-A hipsters, so we'll be using OpenCV, a computer vision (*buzzword!*) platform, to build this ourselves.
2. This picture should then be plopped into some machine-learning algorithm (*yay! more buzzwords!*) that will tell us (hopefully), which numeric code (Unicode) corresponds to that emoji.

### Some Notes :grin:
> Yes, this is an arguably absurdly contrived example on which to learn some basic machine learning and computer vision. 
> Yes, there are likely better ways to do this than using machine learning, especially since these emoji are characters and can be mapped back to their unicode equivalents without machine learning
> Given the above two things, we designed the project this way because it seemed fun and entertaining
> Please do not take this project in any way, shape, or form as a representation of all that either machine learning or computer vision are capable - this barely scratches the surface of either field

### Conclusion :heart:
We sincerely hope that you enjoy working through this project and go on to pursue your interest in both machine learning and computer vision!
